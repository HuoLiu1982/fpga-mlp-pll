# LMLP

This is the repository for the LMLP project.
The LMLP project is aimed at developing a low-cost, low-power, and high-throughput machine learning processor for edge computing applications. The processor will be designed to be compatible with various edge computing platforms, including mobile devices, wearable devices, and IoT devices. The processor will be designed to be highly efficient, with high performance and low power consumption. The processor will also be designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to handle a wide range of applications and data sizes. The processor will be designed to be modular, with the ability to be easily integrated into existing systems and platforms.
The LMLP project is being developed by a team of researchers at Beijing Institute of Technology, led by Student<Junwei Chen>. 
All this forder contains the noise-big solutions.
